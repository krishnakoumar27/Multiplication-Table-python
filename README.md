## Mutliplication Table using python and pyfpdf
- I have used the **pyfpdf** for converting the tables into pdf format. 
- **pypdf** package is used to create pdf in python. 
- For further reading on pypdf, refer the official documentation [here](https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
- The Multiplication tables 50 x 50 in pdf format divided into 10 parts can also be found in this repo.

## [John Leslie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leslie_(physicist)) one of the greastest physicist and mathematician recommends young pupils to memorize the multiplication tables up to 50 x 50. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table)
